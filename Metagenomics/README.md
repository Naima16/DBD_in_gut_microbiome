Code for investigating the "diversity begets diversity" hypothesis in gut microbiota of healthy human adults, adapted from https://github.com/benjaminhgood/microbiome_evolution

To set up for use:
- Download a copy of the MIDAS database of reference genomes
- Download PATRIC kegg/feature files for all genomes in the MIDAS database
- Obtain MIDAS output for HMP1-2 dataset (should be a single directory containing merged genes, snps, species output)
- Run postprocessing scripts (postprocess/calculate_...) if necessary
- Make a symbolic link to utils under postprocess
