### Content :
* Figures: Code to generate all figures and supplementary figures.
* GAMs : Code for generalized additive mixed models with polymorphism rate in a focal species as a function of community diversity estimated with Shannon, species richness on the whole data and rarefied richness.
* GLMMs : Code for generalized linear mixed models with strain count in a focal species as a function of community diversity estimated with Shannon, species richness on the whole data and rarefied richness.
* HMP_time_series : Generalized mixed models with genetic change between two time points as a function of diversity at the earlier time point (HMP time series)
* Poyet_time_series : Generalized mixed models with genetic change between two time points as a function of diversity at the earlier time point (Poyet time series)
* data_Tables : all data tables from Midas pipeline used to fit the models and to generate the Figure.
