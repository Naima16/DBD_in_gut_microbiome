* Generalized mixed models to test the relationship between within-species genetic change between two time points and community diversity at the earliest time point 
* Poyet time series have a higher temporal resolution compared to HMP time series where individuals were sampled only twice-three times. Poyet data is a longitudinal metagenomic data from four highly frequently sampled healthy stool donors (Poyet et al., 2019).
* We tested the relationship between genetic change between two time points (estimated with Polymorphism change, gene gain and gene loss) and community diversity (estimated with Shannon diversity, species richness).
