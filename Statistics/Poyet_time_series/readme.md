* Generalized mixed models to test the relationship between within-species genetic change between two time points and community diversity at the earliest time point in Poyet time series.
* Poyet data (Poyet et al., 2019) has a higher temporal resolution compared to HMP time series where individuals were sampled only twice-three times.
* We tested the relationship between genetic changes between two time points (estimated with Polymorphism change, gene gain and gene loss) and community diversity at the earlier time point (estimated with Shannon diversity, species richness).
