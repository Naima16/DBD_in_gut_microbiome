Generalized mixed models to test the relationship between within-species genetic change between two time points and community diversity at the earliest time point 
The data used here have a higher temporal resolution compared to HMP time series where individuals were sampled only twice-three times, here we have longitudinal metagenomic data from four highly frequently sampled healthy stool donors (data from Poyet et al., 2019).
We tested genetic change between two time points (estimated with Polymorphism change, gene gain and gene loss) with community diversity (estimated with Shannon diversity, species richness).
