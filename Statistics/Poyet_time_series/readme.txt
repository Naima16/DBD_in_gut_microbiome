These generalized mixed models are fit to test the relationship between within-species genetic diversity and community diversity at a higher temporal resolution compared to HMP time series where individuals were sampled twice-three times only, here we have longitudinal metagenomic data from four highly frequently sampled healthy stool donors (hosts am, an, ao and ae from Poyet et al., 2019).
We tested genetic change between two time points (estimated with Polymorphism change, gene gain, gene loss relationship) with community diversity (estimated with Shannon diversity, species richness).
For ore details see Madi et al.2023.
